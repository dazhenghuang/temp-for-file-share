Copy both of these somewhere on your harddrive. By sure to change
the cryptoSystem.properties file to match up with the paths to the
SeniorDesign/sys/ directory including:
   bulks
   decrypted
   ivs
   pieces
   temp
   clean.bat
   Index.index

Also be sure to modify the clean.bat file to match up with the new
directory system as well. The first line and third lines are the only
lines that need modification. clean.bat is for the restart button.
